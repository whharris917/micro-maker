function [S_star, Recon] = Reconstruct(Recon, max_iterations, startm)
% Reconstruct - This function runs the reconstruction algorithm using the
% reconstruction struct passed to it. The Recon object must be created with
% either SetupRecon or SetupReconMultiRes.
%
% Syntax:  [S_star, Recon] = Reconstruct(Recon, max_iterations, startm)
%
% Inputs:
%    Recon - A reconstruction struct created by either SetupRecon or
%    SetupReconMultiRes.
%
%    max_iterations - Either a vector of length Recon.NUM_LEVELS or a
%    scalar specifiying the number of iterations to run the reconstruction
%    at each level. The levels are ordered from highest resolution to
%    lowest resolution. It is wise to choose a low number of resolutions
%    for higher resolutions because they take much longer. For example, for
%    a three level reconstruction something like [5, 50, 100] might work
%    well. This is very problem dependent thought as some reconstructions
%    take longer to converge than others.
%
%    startm - The starting guess microstructure to work with. This must be
%    the size of the lowest level resolution in your reconstruction
%    hierarchy. That is, Recon.ReconObjects{Recon.NUM_LEVELS}.RECON_SIZE.
%
% Outputs:
%    RS - The reconstruction struct containing all data structures
%    needed for performing a reconstruction optimization.
%
% Example: 
%    RS = SetupRecon(params);
%
% Other m-files required: 
% MAT-files required: ThresholdToVf.m PlotIteration.m. PlotIterationGrainMap.m
